## Choose Your Destiny

We're going to spend some time on this one, so it's time to Choose Your Own Adventureâ„¢.

* If you're new in town, think about building the (Local Events Aggregator)[happenings.md].
* If you like a challenge parsing poorly structured data, advance to the (Congressional Trends Feed)[opposite_of_progress.md].
* If you're into Sportsball, give a shot to the (Home Game Ticket Finder)[tickets.md].
* If none of these things apply to you, but you have experienced weather events in the past, turn to page 46 and take a big whiff of the (Forecast Reminder)[event_system.md].
* If you're probably going to code until you go to bed tonight, where you'll dream about coding some more, let's just be honest with ourselves and go to the (Git Work Calendar)[erdone.md].
* Alternatively, if none of these strike your fancy, work with your trainer to find a useful idea for a JSON service to expose inside the company.

Good luck!
