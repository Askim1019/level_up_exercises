## Choose Your Destiny

We're going to spend some time on this one, so it's time to Choose Your Own Adventureâ„¢. You'll be writing one of these Rails applications and refactoring it for a while, so pick something interesting.

* If you're new in town, think about building the [Local Events Aggregator](happenings/).
* If you like a challenge parsing poorly structured data, advance to the [Congressional Trends Feed](opposite_of_progress/).
* If none of these things apply to you, but you have experienced weather events in the past, turn to page 46 and take a big whiff of the [Forecast Reminder](event_system/).
* If you're probably going to code until you go to bed tonight, where you'll dream about coding some more, let's just be honest with ourselves and go to the [Git Work Calendar](erdone/).
* Alternatively, if none of these strike your fancy, work with your trainer to find a useful idea for a JSON service to expose inside the company.

Good luck!
