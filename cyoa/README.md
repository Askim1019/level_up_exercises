## Choose Your Destiny

We're going to spend some time on this one, so it's time to Choose Your Own Adventureâ„¢.

* If you're new in town, think about building the [happenings.md](Local Events Aggregator).
* If you like a challenge parsing poorly structured data, advance to the [opposite_of_progress.md](Congressional Trends Feed).
* If you're into Sportsball, give a shot to the [tickets.md](Home Game Ticket Finder).
* If none of these things apply to you, but you have experienced weather events in the past, turn to page 46 and take a big whiff of the [event_system.md](Forecast Reminder).
* If you're probably going to code until you go to bed tonight, where you'll dream about coding some more, let's just be honest with ourselves and go to the [erdone.md](Git Work Calendar).
* Alternatively, if none of these strike your fancy, work with your trainer to find a useful idea for a JSON service to expose inside the company.

Good luck!
